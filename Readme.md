Welcome to the Robo3000 project!

Robo3000 is designed to traverse a distance whilst utilizing:
                                                    a. GPS
                                                    b. LIDAR
                                                    c. Computer Vision
                                                    d. IMU
                                                    e. Odometry
                                                    
The goal is to map the traversed area while navigating between lines, avoidoing potholes and objects, and navigating to gps waypoints.
Through this navigation the goal of the robot is to find the most efficient path to take, while storing map information.
